Aloha, everyone!

My name is Laila Abella and I will be one of your TAs for this semester. I am still working on getting my degrees, so I understand the challenges of being in a tough class, which this class definitely is. Don’t let that discourage you, though! The class may be hard, but it is just as rewarding in the end.

I chose MIS as one of my degrees because, in this day and age, technology is everywhere, and it’ll only get more advanced in the future. Right now, almost all companies are shifting to include MIS as their way to secure their sites, attract more customers, and grow their business. MIS plays an important role all around the world.

If you need help with anything at all, feel free to contact me via email or text. I prefer emails when it is coding issues you are having trouble with and texts for general question. My number can be found on the home page of Laulima as TA2.

Don’t stress too much. The TAs are here to help at any time you need.
